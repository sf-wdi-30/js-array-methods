## Why is this important?
*This workshop is relevant to developers because:*

- You will use array and array manipulations daily.
- Understanding built-in methods and callbacks will increase the quality of your code.

## What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Create arrays and store them in variables
- Access and change information inside arrays with array methods
-  Explain examples that use callback functions to create more flexible code
-  Traverse arrays with `for` loops and the `forEach` iterator array method

## Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

- Identify an array of elements
- Open, edit, and save a `.js` file in Atom
- Evaluate simple lines of code in the Chrome Developer Console or Node REPL

##Array Method Basics##

```javascript
var fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry",
"Fig", "Guava", "Huckleberry", "Ice plant", "Jackfruit"];
```

Accessing the **first** element:  

```javascript
fruits[0];
//=> "Apple"
```

Accessing the **length**:

```javascript
fruits.length;
//=> 10
```
Accessing the **last** element:  

```javascript
fruits[fruits.length-1];
//=> "Jackfruit
```
**Adding** an element to the **front**:

```javascript
fruits.unshift("Apricot");
//=> 11
```

**Adding** an element to the **end**:  

```javascript
fruits.push("Kiwi");
//=> 12
```

**Removing** an element from the **front**:

```javascript
fruits.shift();
//=> "Apricot"
```

**Removing** an element from the **end**:  

```javascript
fruits.pop();
//=> "Kiwi"
```
**Finding** the index of an element:  

```javascript
fruits.indexOf("Jackfruit");
//=> 9

fruits[9];
//=>"Jackfruit"
```

**Removing** an element by index position:  

```javascript
var huckleBerryPos = fruits.indexOf("HuckleBerry");
var removedItem = fruits.splice(huckleBerryPos, 1);
//=> ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry", "Fig", "Guava", "Ice plant", "Jackfruit"];
```

## Basic array traversal with `for` ##

By now you've all used `for` to iterate over your arrays.  

```js
var fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry",
"Fig", "Guava", "Huckleberry", "Ice plant", "Jackfruit"];

for (var i=0; i<fruits.length; i++) {
  console.log("eating a", fruits[i]);
}
```

## Passing functions to other functions ##

When we call a function, we usually pass some arguments to it.  For example here, we're passing a string `Strawberry` to the `indexOf` function.

```js
fruits.indexOf("Strawberry");
```
We can do this with our own functions as well.

```javascript
function makeSandwich(meat, cheese) {
  return "bread, " + meat + ", " + cheese + ", bread";
}

/* call makeSandwich and pass arguments to it */
makeSandwich("turkey", "provolone");  
//=> "bread, turkey, provolone, bread"

```


Arguments can also be passed in with their variable names.

```javascript
var favoriteMeat = "ham";
/* call makeSandwich with favoriteMeat and "colby" */
makeSandwich(favoriteMeat, "colby");
//=> "bread, ham, colby, bread"
```

We can pass other types of arguments too, including arrays and objects.

```js
function makeBigSandwich(toppingsArray) {
  return "bread," + toppingsArray.toString() + ", & bread";
}

makeBigSandwich(['ham', 'salami', 'provolone']);
//=> "bread, ham, salami, provolone, & bread"
```

<br>
**We can also pass functions as arguments.**  In fact, JavaScript treats functions a lot like any other data type; you can pass them into other functions as arguments, return functions from functions, and store them in variables. 

When a function is passed in as an argument, it can be called within the function at whim.  

First let's look at a function that just uses another function.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  var result = a + b;
  console.log(result);
  return result; 
}

add(4, 6);
//=> 10

```

<details>
  <summary>What are the two functions that are executed above when we call `add`?</summary>
  >The functions that are executed are `add` and `console.log`
</details>


Now let's make our `add` function a little more flexible. We'd like the option to display the result in multiple ways instead of always using `console.log`.  We'll remove `console.log` and pass in a more generic display function to call instead.

```javascript

function toParagraph(input) {
  return "<p>" + input + "</p>";
}

function toCurrency(input) {
  return "$" + input.toFixed(2);
}

function add(a, b, formatFunction) {
  var result = a + b;
  return formatFunction(result);
}

add(2, 2, toParagraph);
//=> "<p>4</p>"

add(2, 2, toCurrency);
//=> "$4.00"

```

When a function takes in another function and calls it, we say the second function is a "callback" function.  

<details>
	<summary>
		Which function above is a callback function?
	</summary>
The `add` function above requires three arguments to work: a number (`a`), another number (`b`), and a callback function (`formatFunction`). The 3rd argument, "formatFunction" is just a placeholder/slot for our two formatting functions: `toCurrency` and `toParagraph`, but we have the flexibility to create new formatting functions now (`toRomanNumeral`! `toFraction`!), without needing to modify `add`.
	  
</details>

We can also use a different function as the `formatFunction`.  This gives us a lot of flexibility.

```javascript
function toAlert(input) {
  alert(input);
}

// then calling it:
add(8, 9, toAlert); // **alerts 17**
//=> undefined
```

A common way to write this is to define the `displayFunction` function **in-line** with the main function call.

```javascript

// defining our specific display function as we call the add function ("in-line"):
add(8, 9, function toAlert(input) {
  alert(input);
}); 
// **alerts 17**
//=> undefined
```

Let's have another example, a more delicious example:

```javascript
function eatSandwich(topping1, topping2, topping3, sandwichMaker) {
    console.log("I'm going to make and eat a sandwich with: " + topping1 + ', ' + topping2 + ' and ' + topping3);
    
    var layers = [topping1, topping2, topping3];
    var sandwich = sandwichMaker(layers);
    
    return ("Finished eating my " + sandwich + " sandwich!");
}

function makeBigSandwich(toppingsArray) {
  return "bread, " + toppingsArray.toString() + ", & bread";
}

/* call the function: */
eatSandwich('bacon', 'lettuce', 'tomato', makeBigSandwich);
//=> I'm going to make and eat a sandwich with bacon, lettuce, and tomato
//=> Finished eating my bread, bacon, lettuce, tomato, & bread sandwich!
```

We passed the `makeBigSandwich` function to the `eatSandwich` function as an argument.  `eatSandwich` calls `makeBigSandwich`.

![img](http://i.giphy.com/ZgWYWo814vti8.gif)

And now we'll re-write this with the function definition in-line with the function call.

```javascript

// eatSandwich stays the same
function eatSandwich(topping1, topping2, topping3, sandwichMaker) {
    console.log("I'm going to make and eat a sandwich with: " + topping1 + ', ' + topping2 + ' and ' + topping3);
    var layers = [topping1, topping2, topping3];
    var sandwich = sandwichMaker(layers);
    return ("Finished eating my " + sandwich + " sandwich!");
}

// then to call the function:
eatSandwich('bacon', 'lettuce', 'tomato', function makeBigSandwich(toppingsArray) {
  return "bread," + toppingsArray.toString() + "&bread";
});
```

## Array Traversals and Actions ##

Let's get back to arrays.

We've seen we can traverse an array of elements with a simple `for` loop, but this isn't the most streamlined approach to accessing and changing a list in Javascript.

Javascript has provided us with quite a few powerful built-in "iterator" methods that make it a breeze to do something to each element in an array. Plus, they give us great opportunities to practice using callbacks! 

*Being able to use these methods is one sign of a more mature developer.  We encourage you to use iterators instead of traditional `for` loops wherever you can!*



### `array.forEach()` ###

To loop through an array with the ability to alter each element, similar to a `for` loop traversal, JavaScript gives us an Array method called `forEach()`.

**`forEach` function skeleton**:

```javascript
array.forEach(function callBack(element, index) {
    console.log(index + ". " + element);
});
```

Fruity Example - Make a numbered list

```javascript
fruits.forEach(function callBack(element, index) {
  console.log(index + ". " + element);
});
// =>	0. Apple
// =>	1. Banana
// =>	2. Cherry
// =>	3. Durian
// =>	4. Elderberry
// =>	5. Fig
// =>	6. Guava
// =>	7. Huckleberry
// =>	8. Ice plant
// =>	9. Jackfruit

```
